Window object
It is a global object for JS code and represents the “browser window” and provides methods to control it.

DOM(Document Object Model)
DOM represents all page content as objects that can be modified. The document object is the main entry point for the page.
Every html tag is an object

In DOM null means does not exist


elem.childNodes - return a collection(iterable like array, but other array methods won't work), and this includes text nodes and 
comment nodes too

attributes ; firstChild, lastChild, parentNode
method : hasChildNodes()

DOM collections are read only - i.e we can't do this elem.childNodes[i] = newNode;
DOM collections are live - i.e. if we have a reference to elem.childNodes, and we remove nodes from it then it will reflect in the
reference, there are minor exceptions

Use for...of loop to iterate over DOM collections
Descendants - all the direct children and the nested children 

Navigation here we are referring as properties use to navigate the html document
Now lets see navigation properties that only take care of element tags(and not text and comment nodes)
parentElement - same as parentNode as most have element node(tag) as a parent, exception is <html> its parent is document which is not a element node
children

Certian DOM elements like table, form have additional properties specific to the element


document.getElementById - it can be only called with document obj not with any element, as it seraches for the Id in the whole document

elem.querySelectorAll - it is the most versatile method it return a collection of elements inside the elem that matches the 
given css selector, :hover, :active can also be used inside this


elem.matches(css) - it return true/false only, not the element


BOM(Browser Object Model)
It represents additional objects provided by the Browser(host environment) for working with everything except document
Like navigator, location, the function alert, prompt, confirm are also part of this
